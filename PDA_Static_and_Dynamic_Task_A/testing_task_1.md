#For this method (checkforAce), i would rephrase it as check_for_Ace, the equals sign should be double.

#In above, for the method (highest_card), dif should be def. Return card.name should read "card1.suit".
#Remove one endand move it to end of next method as it is for initialize method.

#First, assign total to be equal to 0.
#For the return string + integer, we may decide to convert the integer to string as as to make a complete sentence at return.
